# What Can You Build Now?

You've just learned the fundamentals of CrewAI — defining an **Agent** with a role, goal, and backstory, writing a **Task** with structured instructions and input placeholders, wiring them into a **Crew**, and running it all with `kickoff()`. These are the same building blocks behind every AI agent system in production today.

Here are **10 real-world projects** you can build right now with what you've learned.

## 1. Resume Screener

> Instantly evaluate whether a candidate is a fit for a role.


|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**      | Takes a job description and resume text as input. The agent evaluates the resume against the JD and returns a fit verdict — `Strong Fit`, `Moderate Fit`, or `Weak Fit` — with a short justification. |
| **Why it matters**    | Recruiters spend ~7 seconds scanning a resume. This agent does it in under 3 seconds with consistent criteria every time. Companies like HireVue and Lever use similar AI screening at scale.         |
| **Skills you'll use** | Single agent, dual-input placeholders (`{resume}`, `{job_description}`), structured classification output.                                                                                            |

|                       |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**      | Takes a product review and classifies it as `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral` with a one-line explanation of the primary sentiment driver.                               |
| **Why it matters**    | E-commerce brands like Amazon and Shopify merchants process millions of reviews. Automated sentiment analysis powers product ranking, seller feedback, and trend detection. |
| **Skills you'll use** | Single agent, text classification with reasoning, structured expected output.                                                                                               |

## 3. Email Tone Rewriter

> Rewrite any email to match the exact tone you need.


|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**      | Takes a draft email and a desired tone (`formal`, `friendly`, `apologetic`, `urgent`) and rewrites the email while preserving the original meaning.                                |
| **Why it matters**    | Tone mismatches cause real business damage — a blunt email to a client, or an overly casual message to a VP. Tools like Grammarly's tone detector are built on this exact pattern. |
| **Skills you'll use** | Single agent, dual-input placeholders (`{email}`, `{tone}`), text transformation task.                                                                                             |

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**      | Takes a meeting transcript and produces a structured summary: key decisions made, action items with owners, deadlines mentioned, and open questions.                                  |
| **Why it matters**    | Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, and Notion AI all monetize meeting summarization. Every company with remote teams needs this — it's one of the highest-demand AI use cases in the enterprise. |
| **Skills you'll use** | Single agent, long-form input via `{transcript}` placeholder, structured multi-section expected output.                                                                               |

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**      | Takes a target company name and your product description, then generates a personalized cold outreach email with a compelling subject line, pain-point hook, and clear CTA. |
| **Why it matters**    | Sales teams at companies like Outreach.io and Apollo.io use AI-generated personalized emails to increase reply rates by 2-3x over generic templates.                        |
| **Skills you'll use** | Single agent, dual-input placeholders (`{company}`, `{product}`), content generation task.                                                                                  |

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Skills you'll use** | Single agent, `{idea}` input placeholder, multi-section analytical output with scoring.                                                                                                                   |


---

> **Tip**: Each of these projects follows the same pattern you learned in the workshop — define an Agent, write a Task, create a Crew, and `kickoff()`. The only things that change are the role, the instructions, and the input placeholders. Start with one, get it working, then try another.
